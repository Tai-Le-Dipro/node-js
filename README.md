### Accessing your database with Prisma Client

* #### Generating Prisma Client
Note that the installation of this package invokes the `prisma generate` command which reads your Prisma schema and _generates_ the Prisma Client code. The code will be located in `node_modules/.prisma/client`, which is exported by `node_modules/@prisma/client/index.d.ts`.

After you change your data model, you'll need to manually re-generate Prisma Client to ensure the code inside `node_modules/.prisma/client` get updated:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

Refer to the documentation for more information about ["generating the Prisma client"](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/generating-prisma-client).
